Building a calculator app for a local desktop using Python:

1. Back-End (Python Logic):

Python will handle the core functionality of the calculator—performing arithmetic operations. 

 Defined functions to handle basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Front-End (User Interface):

Since this is a desktop app, I need a GUI framework.

	•	Tkinter (built into Python): The default Python GUI library for simple applications.
	

5. Packaging the App:

Once the app is built, you can package it into an executable file using tools like:

	•	PyInstaller: Converts Python scripts into standalone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
