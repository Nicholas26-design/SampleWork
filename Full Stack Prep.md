For full stack development with Python, a combination of languages and tools across the front-end, back-end, and database layers is typically used. Here’s a breakdown of how Python fits into a full stack environment:

1. Front-End Technologies:

	•	HTML/CSS: Standard for structuring and styling web pages.
	•	JavaScript: Essential for adding interactivity to the web interface.
	•	Frameworks/Libraries:
	•	React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, often paired with Python back-end frameworks.
	•	Vue.js: Another front-end framework that is beginner-friendly.
	•	Angular: A full-fledged front-end framework often used for large-scale applications.
	•	Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS: CSS frameworks for responsive design and faster UI development.

2. Back-End Technologies:

	•	Python: The core language for back-end development.
	•	Frameworks:
	•	Django: A high-level Python framework that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. It includes everything from routing to ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for databases.
	•	Flask: A microframework for Python that offers more flexibility for smaller projects or those needing more control over components.
	•	APIs:
	•	FastAPI: A modern, fast Python framework used for building APIs.
	•	GraphQL: An alternative to REST APIs, which can be used with Python.

3. Databases:

	•	SQL-based: Python works well with relational databases such as:
	•	PostgreSQL: Often used with Django.
	•	MySQL.
	•	NoSQL: Python can integrate with NoSQL databases like:
	•	MongoDB.
	•	Redis for caching.

4. Other Components:

	•	Version Control: Git/GitHub or GitLab for code collaboration.
	•	Deployment:
	•	Docker: For containerization and ensuring consistent development environments.
	•	Kubernetes: For managing containerized applications.
	•	Heroku/Netlify: Cloud platforms for easy Python web app deployment.
	•	Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for handling user authentication in your Python application.

Combining these with Python makes for a comprehensive full-stack setup.
